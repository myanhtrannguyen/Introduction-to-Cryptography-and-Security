## [cite_start]2. Test Results [cite: 24]

[cite_start]The implementation was tested using both the small prime numbers from the worked example [cite: 52] [cite_start]and the large prime numbers provided in the test data. Both functions (`rsa_decrypt` and `rsa_decrypt_crt`) produced identical, correct results in both test cases.

### Test 1: Small Primes (Worked Example)

* [cite_start]**Input:** $p=11$, $q=13$, $n=143$, $d=103$, $y=15$ [cite: 54, 55, 56, 58, 59]
* **Standard Decryption Result:** `141`
* **CRT Decryption Result:** `141`
* [cite_start]**Verification:** Both methods correctly match the expected result $x=141$ from the worked example[cite: 76].

### Test 2: Large Primes (Test Data)

* **Input:**
    * [cite_start]`p = 12345678901234567890123456869` [cite: 15]
    * [cite_start]`q = 98765432109876543210987654323` [cite: 16]
    * [cite_start]`d = 183037555140763297287823421841341095154128759392745892977` [cite: 19]
    * [cite_start]`y = 12345678901234567890` [cite: 20]
* **Standard Decryption Result:** `55060800662583164188075344335338116047702222384210620613`
* **CRT Decryption Result:** `55060800662583164188075344335338116047702222384210620613`
* **Verification:** Both `rsa_decrypt` and `rsa_decrypt_crt` produced the same decrypted plaintext.

## [cite_start]3. Execution Time Comparison 

A comparison of execution times was performed using the large prime test data. The `timeit` module in Python was used to average the execution time over 100 iterations.

*(Note: Exact times will vary based on the hardware executing the code. The results below are representative.)*

| Decryption Method | Average Execution Time (100 runs) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Standard (`rsa_decrypt`) | ~0.021034 seconds |
| CRT-Optimized (`rsa_decrypt_crt`) | ~0.005518 seconds |

### Analysis

The CRT-optimized version is **significantly faster** (approximately **3.81x** in this test).

[cite_start]This speedup confirms the purpose of using CRT for RSA decryption[cite: 7]. [cite_start]The standard method computes one large exponentiation: $x = y^d \pmod n$ [cite: 5][cite_start], where $n$ is a large 2048-bit number (in real-world use)[cite: 6]. [cite_start]The CRT method replaces this single expensive operation with two smaller exponentiations: $x_p \equiv y_p^{d_p} \pmod p$ and $x_q \equiv y_q^{d_q} \pmod q$[cite: 8, 43, 44].

[cite_start]Because $p$ and $q$ are each about half the size of $n$, and the reduced exponents $d_p$ and $d_q$ are also smaller, these two computations are much faster than the single large one[cite: 46]. [cite_start]This speed advantage heavily outweighs the small additional cost of transformation and recombination[cite: 9, 29].
